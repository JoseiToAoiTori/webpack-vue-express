# webpack-vue-express

A template for webpack projects utilizing a VueJS front-end, an Express back-end and bulma.io as a CSS framework. Doing this so I don't have to configure webpack every time for a new project. Edit `public/template.html`, `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` to set up some names and stuff.
